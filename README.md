How to Use
----------

**Import Wavefront metrics reporter**

```javascript
metrics = require('wavefrontmetrics');
```

**Setting up a Wavefront Reporter**

A wavefront reporting interface exists for reporting metrics on a recurring interval.  Reporters can be found in [reporting/](reporting).

```javascript
// Report to wavefront proxy server every 1000ms.
var report = new metrics.Report();
report.addMetric('com.co.thingA', counter);
//Wavefront proxy listens on port 2878 by default
var reporter = new WavefrontReporter(report, "host1", config.address, config.port,{ tag0: "default" }); //key-value pair object to be passed as Global tags
reporter.start(1000);
```

**Reporting different metric types**
Examples can be found in [test/][unit/](helper_tags.js).

**Adding a counter**
```javascript
//adding a counter
var counter = new Counter({ 'tag1-counter': "countertag_helper" });
counter.inc(5);
report.addMetric("basicCount", counter);
//example output - basicCount.count 5 1489188569.547 tag1-counter=countertag_helper tag0=default
```
**Adding a meter**
```javascript
//adding a meter
var meter = new Meter({ 'tag1-meter': "metertag_helper" });
meter.mark(10);
report.addMetric("myapp.Meter", meter);
//example output - host1.myapp.Meter.count  10 1489188568.542 tag1-meter=metertag_helper tag0=default  
```
